# UMD_EE_MachineLearning
This repository contains two projects completed in ENEE436: Foundations of Machine Learning. See the README within each project for more details on implementation.

## Project 1
Task 1: Classify the subject in the test image.  
Task 2: Create a classifier that given an test image, tells us whether it is a neutral face or contains a facial expression.
